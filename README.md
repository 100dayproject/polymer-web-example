# PolymerExample-

PolymerExample- is a simple web interface buil with [webcomponents](http://webcomponents.org/) & [polymer 1.0](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/). It is released under the MIT License. This code is being developed and maintained by Vietworm.

# Example

You can find an demo at: [http://polymer.100dayproject.org/](http://polymer.100dayproject.org/)

# Installation/Configuration

To install [Bower](http://bower.io/) through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) & install bower dependencies you need to execute the following commands:

```
npm install bower -g
git clone https://github.com/100dayproject/polymer-web-example.git
cd polymer-web-example
bower install
```
Mmm. For routing to work, you must use a basic web server (I accomplish this by running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337` from the project folder and then visiting `127.0.0.1:1337` in my browser.)
